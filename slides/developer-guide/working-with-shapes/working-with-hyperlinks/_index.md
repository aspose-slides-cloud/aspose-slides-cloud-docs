You can create hyperlinks using **HyperlinkClick** or **HyperlinkMouseOver** properties. Those properties are available for **ShapeBase** and **Portion** objects. Thus, you can have hyperlinks activated on click or on mouse hover; the active area for a link can be an entire shape or a text portion.
There are no special methods for hyperlinks; you use the regular methods for shapes and paragraphs to get or set hyperlink contents.

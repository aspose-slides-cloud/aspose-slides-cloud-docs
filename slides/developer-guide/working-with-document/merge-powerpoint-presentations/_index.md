## **Introduction**

Aspose.Slides Cloud API provides features for merging PowerPoint presentations. You can merge all slides from your presentations, or just the ones you select. If some presentations are protected to open, passwords can be specified for them. You can save the result of a merge in a storage or get the result as a local file.

The following articles describe methods for merging presentations.

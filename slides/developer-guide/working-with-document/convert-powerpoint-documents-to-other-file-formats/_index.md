## **Introduction**

You can convert presentations to different formats using Aspose.Slides Cloud API in your applications. Many file formats have common and their own parameters. You can set these parameters, affecting the final result. Password-protected presentations can also be converted to other formats if a password is provided. Sometimes you only need to convert part of a presentation to a different format. You can do this by specifying the indexes of the slides to be converted. In addition, you can also specify a storage folder containing external fonts that can be used in the presentation, and other options.



## **SDK Source**
Using an SDK (API client) is the quickest way for a developer to speed up the development. An SDK takes care of a lot of low-level details of making requests and handling responses and lets you focus on writing code specific to your particular project. The Aspose.Slides Cloud SDKs can be downloaded from the following page: [Available SDKs](/slides/available-sdks/)
